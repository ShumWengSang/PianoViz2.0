A Minimum Viable Product has just enough core features to effectively deploy the product, and no more.

More detail here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product

You will find here short scripts, light scenes, mono function demos to help you understanding the core of each Maestro capabilities.

Of course, all these stuffs are only for training! Error are not processed and uses cases are very limited. 
But I hope that could be a base for your own developments.

For now, it's quite empty, I will add more and more interesting things over time, generally based on our talks :-) It's always very inspiring.
